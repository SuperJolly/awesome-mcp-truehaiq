# Contributing to Awesome MCP

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Awesome MCP! This document outlines the guidelines for contributing to this curated list of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

## Guidelines for Adding a New Server

### Format Requirements

- Follow the existing format in the README.md:

```markdown
- <img src="server-icon-url" height="14"/> [Server Name](repository-url) - Brief description of the server's functionality
```

### Server Requirements

1. **Must be MCP compatible**: The server must implement the Model Context Protocol specification.
2. **Must be functional**: The server should be working and maintained.
3. **Must have documentation**: Basic usage instructions should be available.

### Description Guidelines

- Keep descriptions clear, concise, and informative
- Focus on the server's main functionality and key features
- Use proper grammar and punctuation
- Avoid marketing language or excessive buzzwords

### Formatting Rules

- **Alphabetical Order**: Place new servers in alphabetical order within their appropriate category
- **Icons**: Include an icon using `<img>` tag with `height="14"` for consistency
- **Categories**: Use the existing categories. If you think a new category is needed, propose it in your PR
- **Duplicates**: If adding an alternative implementation of an existing server, use a superscript number to differentiate (e.g., `<sup><sup>1</sup></sup>`)
- **Special Indicators**: Use `<sup><sup>‚≠ê</sup></sup>` for official implementations from companies/organizations

## Additional Notes

- Check for duplicates before submitting
- Ensure all links are working
- Keep descriptions objective and technical
- Update the table of contents if adding a new category

Thank you for helping make Awesome MCP better!
